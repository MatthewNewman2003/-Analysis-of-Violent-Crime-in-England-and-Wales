# -Analysis-of-Violent-Crime-in-England-and-Wales
This is the code for my analysis of violent crime in England and Wales, which was my Data Analytics assignment at the University of Gloucestershire.

The original datasets, centering around crime rates in different police forces in England and Wales, come from the Office for National Statistics and are in the spreadsheets entitled "policeforceareatablesyearendingmarch[year].csv". Two separate spreadsheets exist; one for the year ending March 2018 and one for the year ending March 2019. The data cleaning code for each is done separately, as well as a missing values heatmap in each to determine which columns to remove, before the spreadsheets are merged in the file entitled "Merging March 2018 and March 2019.py". The data cleaning and merging must be performed before any of the other code can be executed.

All other analysis and modelling code can be executed in a file that is named according to the stage of the analysis it covers (e.g. descriptive analysis of the means of each column is called "Means (Combined Dataset).py"). All code and datasets can be found within the folder "CT5018 Assignment Source Code and Spreadsheets".

The report that was written to accompany the code and set out the analysis results is also embedded, in the file "CT5018 Assignment Report.docx".
